== Description ==

Adds some lovely patriotic bunting and a MIDI clip of Rool Britannia to your WordPress site to celebrate any UK holiday requiring additional patriotism. You can turn off the MIDI in the settings, but clearly that is an unpatriotic thing to do and you shouldn't.

Adapted for WordPress from [Tom Scott's Buntify](http://www.tomscott.com/buntify/) as a patriotic endeavour by [Code for the People](http://codeforthepeople.com/).
